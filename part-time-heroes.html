            Originally, this was only one project for a company I currently work
            for, called Part&dash;Time Heroes. This company is the first studio
            filmed Dungeons &amp; Dragons Livestream company based in Europe.
            They had asked me to design and create their website, with keeping
            the mood and feeling of the company in place. Later on, I also made
            a few other things for the company, such as a flyer, designs for the
            Twitch overlay, Twitch panels, name tags, a stat overlay video and
            currently working on more.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I first heard about this new company and plans for the
            livestream, I was very curious and excited to be a part of it. Now,
            well over half a year later, I'm at this company as a player for the
            show, but also Lead Designer for all the things I've mentioned
            before.
          </p>

          <p>
            First up came the design for the website, where the mood and
            intention of the company was to have an old mage tower / wizard
            theme. It had to be mysterious and magical, but also give a curious
            and inviting sense.
          </p>

          <p>
            The colors and the logo were already established before I worked on
            the designs, and of course these colors for the company (blue and
            orange), had to be incorporated into the design, to give the feeling
            of a branding style.

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>Website & Flyer</h3>
          <p>
            The website was designed in Adobe XD and made in Wix, since they
            already owned an account and a domain, and it was easier to set it
            up that way. I pretty quickly had an idea for the design, and found
            the perfect photo to make it with. The company originally was called
            Just Roll With It, but later changed the name. In my first ideas it
            will however still state the old name.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started off with the photo, which was orignally a bit more on the
            black and white side, and edited it in Photoshop to have a blue hue
            to it, matching it with the brand colors. Then I put that photo as
            background, with a slightly dark overlay on top for readability. I
            tried out two versions of the header, and soon went for the
            borderless style. After I made a few versions of my first hero
            section idea, having a larger or dice iconography, and work with two
            different fonts (one I used before getting the custom font from the
            company, which is also used in the logo). I tried multiple fonts and
            color palettes, to see what would give off the most 'old mage tower'
            vibes, but I didn't use most of them seeing it just didn't feel
            right and so I decided to just work with color variations of the
            blue and orange from the logo, and black and white for optional
            contrast colors. Soon after, I finished the design in Wix itself,
            tweaking the last details there.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the hero section, I continued working on the homepage, adding
            multiple sections with an about and a schedule section among other
            things. Making the footer was done very quickly and given the ease
            of use that Wix provides, it was easy to make something good.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other pages were the cast, stream (schedule) and vacancies page.
            The latter one I made at a later stage, and seeing I already had a
            pretty good idea how things looked, what fonts I used for the
            others, what spacing, etc., I made that last page directly in Wix.
            The other pages I did have some iterations for though and I will put
            those below.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/img/process/PTH/JRWI-icon_edited.png"
            alt="Iconography for Part-Time Heroes, a blue flaming twenty sided die. Made by Simone Ripke, @Simmigraphs"
          />
          <p>
            Then the flyer design. The company (under their old name) already
            had a flyer made by different designers, but in my honest opinion it
            didn't look as good as it should have. Then at the time of the name
            change, I suggested for me to make a new design for a flyer, with
            the new name and new information, which they agreed to.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started this flyer design with writing down everything that needed
            to be in the flyer, for example it had to have the logo, links to
            socials, date and time, and a heading that could grab your
            attention. Then, I knew I wanted to incorporate the cast members of
            the company, but wanted it to remain a bit of a mystery, so I
            decided to use a silhouette. This led to the first version of the
            flyer, which actually didn't change a whole lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was asked by the company to make a few other versions, with for
            example a photo as background with the text on top. I warned them
            that that might not look as well, seeing photo as a background will
            make it less readable and could be busy for the eyes, but I tried my
            best anyway. That's where the other version came to be, but it
            didn't have the same impact and readability as the first one. So, I
            made a few small iterations on the first design, and did use the
            color version of the cast member cutout. I did however, make the
            bottom part one color with a mask, so the text for the socials would
            be readable.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Twitch & Videos</h3>
          <p>
            For Twitch I made multiple things. I started off with making the
            overlay, that would be used for the livestream. I followed some
            guides from another big D&amp;D livestream called Critical Role,
            mainly because they have a similar set up as our cameras and in my
            opinion it would be the most practical. There is one camera for the
            Dungeon Master, and two cameras for the players, one on each side of
            the table. For consistency and eye movement reasons, I put the DM
            camera top left, with under room for potential announcements,
            videos, sponsors / givaways, and more. Then there are two wider
            parts for the two player sides, which is good to have them aligned.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, with that in mind, I started by making a 1920x1080 canvas and
            blocking a few areas for where the cams would be. I did try a few
            other versions with other positions of the cams, but eventually I
            did still went with the one top left, two longer ones right. Then, I
            searched online for inspiration and potential usuable background
            photos, textures or other elements. I also made room at the bottom
            for logos and sponsor logos.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made the first few versions with the blue and orange brand colors
            in mind, and tried a few different ideas. I used cut out screenshots
            from Critical Role, to see how it would potentially look with people
            and a backdrop in frame. These first few versions were, as I look
            back, not the best, but it was a start. They were quite crowded and
            got overwhelming a bit fast. I asked what the people from the
            company thought, and they agreed with what I said, but did really
            like the direction I was going with. So, I made more versions, and
            more, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually I liked the direction of going with a wood/stone
            combination, seeing that would also return in the stream from the
            studio itself. This made me make a few more versions, with slight
            variations. I tried it with a more wooden texture as main background
            with stone borders, the other way around, all wood, all stone, but
            was the happiest with a dark stone background, with grey/dark wood
            borders in between the screens and a stone frame underneath the
            camera frames.
          </p>
          <p>
            The darker background in combination with the lighter studio
            setting, worked really well to give off a professional and calm
            look, together with keeping the mysterious old mage tower effect
            that is part of the companies mood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other things I made for Twitch were the name tags in the live stream
            (not the character art however), the stat cards plus video during
            the stream, and the Twitch Panels on the About section of the
            channel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name tags and the stat overlay were made in a simultaneous
            timeline. I knew what information needed for this, seeing I play a
            lot of the game myself and know what is and is less important for
            other people to know. This really helped with making the design, it
            was done rather quickly and didn't really have any iterations for
            them. I made the designs for both in Adobe Photoshop, and made the
            video version of the stat cards in Adobe Premiere Pro.
          </p>
          <p>
            Same goes for the Twitch Panels to be honest, I was given a list of
            things that needed a design for, came up with a few of my own (I
            used to stream on Twitch for a little bit), and got to designing it
            quite fast. I made use of the already existing design concept from
            the overlay, to use it as a background. Then all what was left was
            getting the right size and spacing, add the iconography, and add
            text.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first version of the Twitch Panels were longer and had the text
            needed in them, but seeing as Twitch would resize these panels to a
            300px width, the text became illegible. So, I just made the designs
            for the headings, and only a few full version ones, where there
            wasn't as much text on it. After I was done, I put them up on the
            Twitch channel, moved them around a bit so they looked good, and
            finished up!
