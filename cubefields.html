            Here we have a project for the company Cubefields. This company is
            dedicated to help teaching people, from younger children to older
            students and adults, through the ability of playing games, with
            Minecraft in particular.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their old website however, needed an upgrade and they asked me to
            make a new design and help them set it up through Webflow. I made
            several iterations, worked with wireframes (lofi, mifi and hifi
            versions), and made designs for all pages on the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old design had a lot of inconsistencies, different font sizes,
            alignment of certain elements all mixed up (text center or left
            aligned, even though its the same kind of text), and had no thought
            about color contrast, having a green background with grey text.
            These are some examples of why the old website needed an upgrade,
            but there were a few more which for time sake I won't go into.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finishing the new designs, I also worked it out through
            Webflow, which I had no experience with yet before starting this
            project, but it felt very intuitive and easy to pick up. Especially
            seeing my knowledge about coding.

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>Start</h3>
          <p>
            I started this project by going through the old website design,
            making screenshots for later reference, and noting down every part
            that needed to be used. I then asked for the logo, and if they
            wanted to keep the website and color scheme like it was and just
            update it, or if they wanted a complete redesign.
          </p>
          <p>
            They went for a combination of those two options, with wanting to
            keep it a bit as the old design, but with room for me to let my
            creative side flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, I made a few different versions of the logo, looked for
            different colors and also looked for different fonts to use.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/img/process/Cubefields/designElements.png"
            alt="a screenshot of the design elements trial"
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>The Design</h3>
          <p>
            I started the design process by making a few different lofi
            wireframe ideas. I knew I liked the broken cube part of the logo,
            and wanted to incorporate that piece a lot more in this new design.
          </p>
          <p>
            After making a few different versions of the lofi wireframe, I asked
            the company which design idea they liked best. They pointed out
            which version they prefered, and I continued working out that
            version.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made lots of iterations, experimenting a lot and saving all the
            versions to ask the companies thoughts at a later point. I made the
            mifi and hifi versions of the final designs, and continued with the
            designs for the other pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having finished the main page design, made it much easier to come up
            with designs for the other pages, especially of course with the
            ability to re-use the header and footer part, which now I just
            needed to make the design for the main.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally finished with all pages, I tried to translate them the best
            I could, to Webflow. At first it was kind of a hassle to learn
            Webflow, a whole new system, figuring out where everything was, how
            the things worked, and what the limits were, but after a few days of
            experimenting, I picked it up quite well. It was then just a matter
            of time before I had every part of the design translated on the
            webpage, and it could go live.
          </p>
