            This was a project for one of my classes, called Project Tech. This
            class was a specialty class which you could sign up for if you
            wanted to dive deeper in coding, where our knowledge of previous
            classes were combined (front-end, back-end and design knowledge).
          </p>

          <p>
            During this project, we were tasked to make a matching application.
            This could mean matching people with people, people to objects or
            locations, but also animals to animals, etc. The project was split
            up into three different classes, but all working on the same
            project.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the Back-End part of the application, it needed to be connected
            to a database, where we also needed to work with CRUD methods, to
            add or update/delete information (i.e. with an sign up or a change
            name option), work with Node and Express JS to set up our own
            Server, and work with a Templating Engine. For the Front-End side of
            this assignment we had to have some sort of Progressive Enhancement
            for our application and work with an third-party API. During this
            project, I have worked with NodeJS, ExpressJS, Sass, HandlebarsJS,
            as well as MongoDB for the database.

            I decided to make an matching application for people, matching them
            with new music. Users of this app can, when making their account,
            select the music that they are already fan off, listening to, or
            preference to certain genres. Then, the app will show them
            recommended music, based on similar artist, songs, or popular tracks
            that others are fan off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users get to like, dislike, or super like a song, and will be able
            to immediately add the song to their music library of choice. Songs
            that they like will also be saved in a Liked Songs library on the
            app itself, so the user can keep track of their liked songs and
            easily find them again if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the app, you can connect with your friends (whome also use the
            app), and you can get matched sooner with songs that your friends
            have also liked (as in, if one or more of your friends like a song,
            that song will appear quicker on your homescreen to match with, then
            songs based of the music library from for example Spotify, Apple
            Music or the In-App Music Library).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm very proud of how the app turned out, and if you want to test it
            out yourself, you can find it at my

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>Start</h3>
          <p>
            I started this project with brainstorming about what kind of
            application I wanted to make, and what makes up a matching
            application. I made a list of what would interest me to make, and
            also listed some features, made a requirement list, and made a
            couple of job stories (one of which I chose to continue working on).
          </p>
          <p>
            After brainstorming, I began to roughly sketch out some wireframes
            of what I invisioned the designs would looked like. After making
            small tweaks here and there, I came up with a final idea of how I
            wanted it to look and what screens I wanted to incorporate.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/img/process/Tech/requirementsText.png"
            alt="screenshot of the brainstorm, concept ideas, features, job stories, and requirement lists."
          />
          <img
            src="./assets/img/process/Tech/sketchWireframes1.png"
            alt="screenshot of the early wireframe sketches, designed by Yara Prins."
          />
          <p>
            When I got the idea a bit more fleshed out, I began to experiment
            with color palettes, and made the first few versions of the design.
            I tried out a few different color combinations for the background,
            and I noticed the black and lilac color combination worked best.
            After deciding on the background colors, I tried out different
            accent color options (for buttons and other), and after landing on
            the light pastel yellow, I started completing my design. When I was
            finished however, I wasn't quite satisfied, I struggled with
            distinguishing buttons from the 'selected' state. and so I made my
            final version, which has the 'selected' state with a small part
            filled in.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>
            With my design finished, it was time to start the coding process.
            This took quite a bit of time, seeing it was my first experience
            with NodeJS, ExpressJS, templating enginges, Sass and MongoDB. I can
            honestly say however, that I've got the basics down for those
            programs, thanks to this project!
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with Express to easily make my own server, was quite nice.
            After learning about the terms and reasons behind writing these
            servers (such as req.params, app.get, res.render, req res), I got
            the hang of it pretty fast, and could try things myself. One thing I
            did struggled with however, was setting up HandlebarsJS and work
            with multiple pages / templates. I didn't notice at first that there
            where three versions of Handlebars, and that I worked with the
            incorrect one for the first few weeks of the project. This resulted
            in unnecessary hard work and after figuring out what went wrong, a
            few deep sighs (and a few smackes on the head whoops). But, besides
            the frustrations I had with Handlebars, I really enjoyed working
            with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was also the first time where I used any sort of
            database. During this project we worked with MongoDB. It wasn't that
            difficult to learn, but it did take a while to set it up correctly.
            The first time that I filled out a form and it was succesfully send
            to my database, that was a very satisfying and awesome feeling!
          </p>

          <p>
            During this project I had to have some sort of Progressive
            Enhancement, and to have worked with a third-party API. I really
            wanted to incorporate the Spotify API, to be able to work with the
            music library and collect data from it, to make my application work.
            Sadly, this didn't work out well, the documentation for the API was
            quite difficult to understand, and what I tried with connecting it
            with a script, didn't work. I also tried to work with other music
            API's, but those needed payment or didn't work on localhost (it
            needed a domain name). So, after discussing it with my professor, we
            decided to skip the music API (keeping it part as my concept, but
            not for my prototype), and configure a random local API, seeing he
            knew I was capable of working with API's, but didn't have the time
            or equipment needed to set it up. For that reason I incorporated the
            geolocation API for the sign up page, instead of the music API.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would have loved to have continued working on this project and
            made my concept and designs all come to life, but with limited time
            and resources this was quite difficult to do. Maybe in the future
            however, I could continue this project and finish the application.

            This was a project for one of my classes, called Project Tech. This
            class was a specialty class which you could sign up for if you
            wanted to dive deeper in coding, where our knowledge of previous
            classes were combined (front-end, back-end and design knowledge).
          </p>

          <p>
            During this project, we were tasked to make a matching application.
            This could mean matching people with people, people to objects or
            locations, but also animals to animals, etc. The project was split
            up into three different classes, but all working on the same
            project.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the Back-End part of the application, it needed to be connected
            to a database, where we also needed to work with CRUD methods, to
            add or update/delete information (i.e. with an sign up or a change
            name option), work with Node and Express JS to set up our own
            Server, and work with a Templating Engine. For the Front-End side of
            this assignment we had to have some sort of Progressive Enhancement
            for our application and work with an third-party API. During this
            project, I have worked with NodeJS, ExpressJS, Sass, HandlebarsJS,
            as well as MongoDB for the database.

            I decided to make an matching application for people, matching them
            with new music. Users of this app can, when making their account,
            select the music that they are already fan off, listening to, or
            preference to certain genres. Then, the app will show them
            recommended music, based on similar artist, songs, or popular tracks
            that others are fan off.
          </p>

            Users get to like, dislike, or super like a song, and will be able
            to immediately add the song to their music library of choice. Songs
            that they like will also be saved in a Liked Songs library on the
            app itself, so the user can keep track of their liked songs and
            easily find them again if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the app, you can connect with your friends (whome also use the
            app), and you can get matched sooner with songs that your friends
            have also liked (as in, if one or more of your friends like a song,
            that song will appear quicker on your homescreen to match with, then
            songs based of the music library from for example Spotify, Apple
            Music or the In-App Music Library).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm very proud of how the app turned out, and if you want to test it
            out yourself, you can find it at my

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>Start</h3>
          <p>
            I started this project with brainstorming about what kind of
            application I wanted to make, and what makes up a matching
            application. I made a list of what would interest me to make, and
            also listed some features, made a requirement list, and made a
            couple of job stories (one of which I chose to continue working on).
          </p>
          <p>
            After brainstorming, I began to roughly sketch out some wireframes
            of what I invisioned the designs would looked like. After making
            small tweaks here and there, I came up with a final idea of how I
            wanted it to look and what screens I wanted to incorporate.
          </p>

          />
          <img

            alt="screenshot of the early wireframe sketches, designed by Yara Prins."
          />
          <p>
            When I got the idea a bit more fleshed out, I began to experiment
            with color palettes, and made the first few versions of the design.
            I tried out a few different color combinations for the background,
            and I noticed the black and lilac color combination worked best.
            After deciding on the background colors, I tried out different
            accent color options (for buttons and other), and after landing on
            the light pastel yellow, I started completing my design. When I was
            finished however, I wasn't quite satisfied, I struggled with
            distinguishing buttons from the 'selected' state. and so I made my
            final version, which has the 'selected' state with a small part
            filled in.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>
            With my design finished, it was time to start the coding process.
            This took quite a bit of time, seeing it was my first experience
            with NodeJS, ExpressJS, templating enginges, Sass and MongoDB. I can
            honestly say however, that I've got the basics down for those
            programs, thanks to this project!
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with Express to easily make my own server, was quite nice.
            After learning about the terms and reasons behind writing these
            servers (such as req.params, app.get, res.render, req res), I got
            the hang of it pretty fast, and could try things myself. One thing I
            did struggled with however, was setting up HandlebarsJS and work
            with multiple pages / templates. I didn't notice at first that there
            where three versions of Handlebars, and that I worked with the
            incorrect one for the first few weeks of the project. This resulted
            in unnecessary hard work and after figuring out what went wrong, a
            few deep sighs (and a few smackes on the head whoops). But, besides
            the frustrations I had with Handlebars, I really enjoyed working
            with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was also the first time where I used any sort of
            database. During this project we worked with MongoDB. It wasn't that
            difficult to learn, but it did take a while to set it up correctly.
            The first time that I filled out a form and it was succesfully send
            to my database, that was a very satisfying and awesome feeling!
          </p>

          <p>
            During this project I had to have some sort of Progressive
            Enhancement, and to have worked with a third-party API. I really
            wanted to incorporate the Spotify API, to be able to work with the
            music library and collect data from it, to make my application work.
            Sadly, this didn't work out well, the documentation for the API was
            quite difficult to understand, and what I tried with connecting it
            with a script, didn't work. I also tried to work with other music
            API's, but those needed payment or didn't work on localhost (it
            needed a domain name). So, after discussing it with my professor, we
            decided to skip the music API (keeping it part as my concept, but
            not for my prototype), and configure a random local API, seeing he
            knew I was capable of working with API's, but didn't have the time
            or equipment needed to set it up. For that reason I incorporated the
            geolocation API for the sign up page, instead of the music API.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would have loved to have continued working on this project and
            made my concept and designs all come to life, but with limited time
            and resources this was quite difficult to do. Maybe in the future
            however, I could continue this project and finish the application.

            This was a project for one of my classes, called Project Tech. This
            class was a specialty class which you could sign up for if you
            wanted to dive deeper in coding, where our knowledge of previous
            classes were combined (front-end, back-end and design knowledge).
          </p>

          <p>
            During this project, we were tasked to make a matching application.
            This could mean matching people with people, people to objects or
            locations, but also animals to animals, etc. The project was split
            up into three different classes, but all working on the same
            project.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the Back-End part of the application, it needed to be connected
            to a database, where we also needed to work with CRUD methods, to
            add or update/delete information (i.e. with an sign up or a change
            name option), work with Node and Express JS to set up our own
            Server, and work with a Templating Engine. For the Front-End side of
            this assignment we had to have some sort of Progressive Enhancement
            for our application and work with an third-party API. During this
            project, I have worked with NodeJS, ExpressJS, Sass, HandlebarsJS,
            as well as MongoDB for the database.

            I decided to make an matching application for people, matching them
            with new music. Users of this app can, when making their account,
            select the music that they are already fan off, listening to, or
            preference to certain genres. Then, the app will show them
            recommended music, based on similar artist, songs, or popular tracks
            that others are fan off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users get to like, dislike, or super like a song, and will be able
            to immediately add the song to their music library of choice. Songs
            that they like will also be saved in a Liked Songs library on the
            app itself, so the user can keep track of their liked songs and
            easily find them again if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the app, you can connect with your friends (whome also use the
            app), and you can get matched sooner with songs that your friends
            have also liked (as in, if one or more of your friends like a song,
            that song will appear quicker on your homescreen to match with, then
            songs based of the music library from for example Spotify, Apple
            Music or the In-App Music Library).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm very proud of how the app turned out, and if you want to test it
            out yourself, you can find it at my

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>Start</h3>
          <p>
            I started this project with brainstorming about what kind of
            application I wanted to make, and what makes up a matching
            application. I made a list of what would interest me to make, and
            also listed some features, made a requirement list, and made a
            couple of job stories (one of which I chose to continue working on).
          </p>
          <p>
            After brainstorming, I began to roughly sketch out some wireframes
            of what I invisioned the designs would looked like. After making
            small tweaks here and there, I came up with a final idea of how I
            wanted it to look and what screens I wanted to incorporate.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/img/process/Tech/requirementsText.png"
            alt="screenshot of the brainstorm, concept ideas, features, job stories, and requirement lists."
          />
          <img
            src="./assets/img/process/Tech/sketchWireframes1.png"
            alt="screenshot of the early wireframe sketches, designed by Yara Prins."
          />
          <p>
            When I got the idea a bit more fleshed out, I began to experiment
            with color palettes, and made the first few versions of the design.
            I tried out a few different color combinations for the background,
            and I noticed the black and lilac color combination worked best.
            After deciding on the background colors, I tried out different
            accent color options (for buttons and other), and after landing on
            the light pastel yellow, I started completing my design. When I was
            finished however, I wasn't quite satisfied, I struggled with
            distinguishing buttons from the 'selected' state. and so I made my
            final version, which has the 'selected' state with a small part
            filled in.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>
            With my design finished, it was time to start the coding process.
            This took quite a bit of time, seeing it was my first experience
            with NodeJS, ExpressJS, templating enginges, Sass and MongoDB. I can
            honestly say however, that I've got the basics down for those
            programs, thanks to this project!
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with Express to easily make my own server, was quite nice.
            After learning about the terms and reasons behind writing these
            servers (such as req.params, app.get, res.render, req res), I got
            the hang of it pretty fast, and could try things myself. One thing I
            did struggled with however, was setting up HandlebarsJS and work
            with multiple pages / templates. I didn't notice at first that there
            where three versions of Handlebars, and that I worked with the
            incorrect one for the first few weeks of the project. This resulted
            in unnecessary hard work and after figuring out what went wrong, a
            few deep sighs (and a few smackes on the head whoops). But, besides
            the frustrations I had with Handlebars, I really enjoyed working
            with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was also the first time where I used any sort of
            database. During this project we worked with MongoDB. It wasn't that
            difficult to learn, but it did take a while to set it up correctly.
            The first time that I filled out a form and it was succesfully send
            to my database, that was a very satisfying and awesome feeling!

            During this project I had to have some sort of Progressive
            Enhancement, and to have worked with a third-party API. I really
            wanted to incorporate the Spotify API, to be able to work with the
            music library and collect data from it, to make my application work.
            Sadly, this didn't work out well, the documentation for the API was
            quite difficult to understand, and what I tried with connecting it
            with a script, didn't work. I also tried to work with other music
            API's, but those needed payment or didn't work on localhost (it
            needed a domain name). So, after discussing it with my professor, we
            decided to skip the music API (keeping it part as my concept, but
            not for my prototype), and configure a random local API, seeing he
            knew I was capable of working with API's, but didn't have the time
            or equipment needed to set it up. For that reason I incorporated the
            geolocation API for the sign up page, instead of the music API.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would have loved to have continued working on this project and
            made my concept and designs all come to life, but with limited time
            and resources this was quite difficult to do. Maybe in the future
            however, I could continue this project and finish the application.
