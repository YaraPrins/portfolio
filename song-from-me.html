            This was a team project, called Project Team 2, better known as "Het
            Passieproject" (translated: "the passion project"). During this
            project, groups were formed based on hobbies, passions, or something
            that we've always wanted to learn. Groups could be formed with all
            the same passion, or as a good addition to the team (where each
            project member would have something else to bring to the team).
          </p>

          <p>
            This project would be made with the team, for one specific person.
            This could be someone that shares the same passion, or someone who
            could make use of the product. The passion for this team was:
            playing the guitar.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, I was part of a team of three. Two of us
            (including myself), have always wanted to learn how to play the
            guitar, and the other person knew how to play and wanted to teach.
          </p>

          <p>
            The person for whom we wanted to make this project, was my lovely
            girlfriend. I knew she wanted to learn as well, but always struggled
            to keep up or keep practicing. That's why we wanted to make an
            application, where we (my team member and myself), would learn how
            to play the guitar, and record our findings and practice sessions.
            This way we wanted to have the app feel like we were on the journey
            together, and have an app where you can practice and rewatch videos
            where you later would perhaps struggle.
          </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>The Design and Iterations</h3>
          <p>
            We devided the design process up into three parts, design for the
            phone, tablet and laptop. While we (project partner and I) were
            keeping ourselves busy with learning the basics of guitar playing,
            the third member of our group made a start for the mobile designs.
            She made a few variations, but we decided to continue with the dark
            red color (this, because it is the favorite color of my girlfriend).
          </p>
          <p>
            We also chose to incorporate songs that meant a lot to her, or to
            us, in the design, so it would have a very personal feeling, that it
            was made especially for her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting with the phone design, we made a few versions and
            iterations (see images below). When we were satisfied with the phone
            design, we converted those designs for tablet and laptop. We still
            had to make a few small iterations for the larger designs, but the
            overall design and mood was set with the phone.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>The Application</h3>
          <p>
            We decided to devide the application into three parts, lessons,
            vlogs and schematics, so that she could decide what she wanted to do
            or see, without needing to go through it all. With each lesson, we
            made a short summary about what it is about, and a link to the vlogs
            from us following that lesson, giving our findings and explaining
            where and why we struggled. The vlog part will consist of a overview
            of all made vlogs by me and the other project partner. In the
            schematics part, you can find an overview of the songs and the tabs
            / chords for them.

            This was a team project, called Project Team 2, better known as "Het
            Passieproject" (translated: "the passion project"). During this
            project, groups were formed based on hobbies, passions, or something
            that we've always wanted to learn. Groups could be formed with all
            the same passion, or as a good addition to the team (where each
            project member would have something else to bring to the team).
          </p>

          <p>
            This project would be made with the team, for one specific person.
            This could be someone that shares the same passion, or someone who
            could make use of the product. The passion for this team was:
            playing the guitar.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, I was part of a team of three. Two of us
            (including myself), have always wanted to learn how to play the
            guitar, and the other person knew how to play and wanted to teach.
          </p>

          <p>
            The person for whom we wanted to make this project, was my lovely
            girlfriend. I knew she wanted to learn as well, but always struggled
            to keep up or keep practicing. That's why we wanted to make an
            application, where we (my team member and myself), would learn how
            to play the guitar, and record our findings and practice sessions.
            This way we wanted to have the app feel like we were on the journey
            together, and have an app where you can practice and rewatch videos
            where you later would perhaps struggle.
          </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>The Design and Iterations</h3>
          <p>
            We devided the design process up into three parts, design for the
            phone, tablet and laptop. While we (project partner and I) were
            keeping ourselves busy with learning the basics of guitar playing,
            the third member of our group made a start for the mobile designs.
            She made a few variations, but we decided to continue with the dark
            red color (this, because it is the favorite color of my girlfriend).
          </p>
          <p>
            We also chose to incorporate songs that meant a lot to her, or to
            us, in the design, so it would have a very personal feeling, that it
            was made especially for her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting with the phone design, we made a few versions and
            iterations (see images below). When we were satisfied with the phone
            design, we converted those designs for tablet and laptop. We still
            had to make a few small iterations for the larger designs, but the
            overall design and mood was set with the phone.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>The Application</h3>
          <p>
            We decided to devide the application into three parts, lessons,
            vlogs and schematics, so that she could decide what she wanted to do
            or see, without needing to go through it all. With each lesson, we
            made a short summary about what it is about, and a link to the vlogs
            from us following that lesson, giving our findings and explaining
            where and why we struggled. The vlog part will consist of a overview
            of all made vlogs by me and the other project partner. In the
            schematics part, you can find an overview of the songs and the tabs
            / chords for them.

            This was a team project, called Project Team 2, better known as "Het
            Passieproject" (translated: "the passion project"). During this
            project, groups were formed based on hobbies, passions, or something
            that we've always wanted to learn. Groups could be formed with all
            the same passion, or as a good addition to the team (where each
            project member would have something else to bring to the team).
          </p>

          <p>
            This project would be made with the team, for one specific person.
            This could be someone that shares the same passion, or someone who
            could make use of the product. The passion for this team was:
            playing the guitar.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, I was part of a team of three. Two of us
            (including myself), have always wanted to learn how to play the
            guitar, and the other person knew how to play and wanted to teach.
          </p>

          <p>
            The person for whom we wanted to make this project, was my lovely
            girlfriend. I knew she wanted to learn as well, but always struggled
            to keep up or keep practicing. That's why we wanted to make an
            application, where we (my team member and myself), would learn how
            to play the guitar, and record our findings and practice sessions.
            This way we wanted to have the app feel like we were on the journey
            together, and have an app where you can practice and rewatch videos
            where you later would perhaps struggle.

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>The Design and Iterations</h3>
          <p>
            We devided the design process up into three parts, design for the
            phone, tablet and laptop. While we (project partner and I) were
            keeping ourselves busy with learning the basics of guitar playing,
            the third member of our group made a start for the mobile designs.
            She made a few variations, but we decided to continue with the dark
            red color (this, because it is the favorite color of my girlfriend).
          </p>
          <p>
            We also chose to incorporate songs that meant a lot to her, or to
            us, in the design, so it would have a very personal feeling, that it
            was made especially for her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting with the phone design, we made a few versions and
            iterations (see images below). When we were satisfied with the phone
            design, we converted those designs for tablet and laptop. We still
            had to make a few small iterations for the larger designs, but the
            overall design and mood was set with the phone.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>The Application</h3>
          <p>
            We decided to devide the application into three parts, lessons,
            vlogs and schematics, so that she could decide what she wanted to do
            or see, without needing to go through it all. With each lesson, we
            made a short summary about what it is about, and a link to the vlogs
            from us following that lesson, giving our findings and explaining
            where and why we struggled. The vlog part will consist of a overview
            of all made vlogs by me and the other project partner. In the
            schematics part, you can find an overview of the songs and the tabs
            / chords for them.
