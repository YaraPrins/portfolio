            This was a project for one of my classes, called Responsive Multi
            Device Design (RMDD). During this project, the focus laid on the
            ability to make an interactive experience, with designing the
            solution for multiple devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Points of interest for this project were to think about the context
            of the user, consistency of the design across devices, and thinking
            about what information needed to be displayed and in what way.
          </p>

          <p>
            The assignment was to come up with and design a multi-device
            experience for a specific activity (such as traveling, fitness,
            going to the movies, playing games, etc.). One of the key points to
            think about where the user goals, that were important before, during
            and after the activity, and what device would be appropriate for
            that occasion.
          </p>

          <p>
            The solution needed to be visualized in a screenflow, so that the
            functionalities of the product would be clearly explained and
            visible across all used devices.

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>Start</h3>
          <p>
            I started with thinking about what kind of activity I wanted to make
            this project for. I had bit of a struggle with this, because I
            didn't want to do something that had been done a lot before, and
            what interested me. I first thought of something with plants or
            crystals, seeing those are two of my hobbies, but after a bit of
            brainstorming, I thought of something that I would have liked to
            exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            I, like you might have noticed, am a huge Dungeons &amp; Dragons
            enthousiast, and that is also the reason why quite a few of my
            projects have something to do with this wonderful hobby. When I'm
            playing D&amp;D myself, I notice that sometimes I struggle when I'm
            deeply in combat or roleplay, to pay attention to everything.
            Especially if my character takes any damage, but for example I was
            figuring out my next turn in combat, I had to break from those plans
            to fill in my damage taken in the Hit Points area.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/img/process/RMDD/wireframeSmartWatch1.png"
            alt="part of the wireframes design for the smartwatch, made by Yara Prins"
          />
          <p>
            This would get a bit frustrating and time consuming after a while,
            and this is where I thought of my concept. D&amp;D Hit Points
            connects your smartwatch to your D&amp;D Beyond Account, letting you
            set your damage or healing with a simple gesture around your wrist,
            letting you keep focus for the rest of the game.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Design &amp; Functionalities</h3>
          <p>
            I started making the designs by working out the wireframes and the
            screenflow of the user experience. First up, the laptop designs. I
            knew I wanted it to connect to an existing d&amp;d tool and website
            called D&amp;D Beyond. I've replicated this website ones during one
            of my <a href="./dndBeyond.html">other projects</a>, but this
            project is an addition to this tool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because I knew that I wanted to add to an already existing website,
            making the laptop designs was very easy and fast to do. I made rough
            wireframes of the existing designs of a charactersheet page, and
            added on top of that. Mainly, adding the buttons and ways to connect
            to your smartwatch. After that, I made a Hi-Fi screenflow how it
            would work, and how potential error states would look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was done with the laptop designs, I tried to translate the
            most important parts the character sheet into the smartwatch app. I
            noted down the things that I needed to have or be able to do in the
            app, and what could be left for the laptop or other device versions.
            After all that, I came with a few things that needed to be included
            in the app: being able to connect to your D&amp;D Beyond account,
            selecting (one of) your character(s), showing your Hit Points and a
            way to edit them, Death Saving Throws, and Conditions (being
            blinded, stunned, poisoned, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            These functionalities needed to be a part of the designs, and I
            slowly started to expand the design. First, just like before, I made
            wireframes for the smartwatch designs, to see the placement and
            sizing of the content. After, I converted those wireframes into a
            Hi-Fi screenflow. I did have some iterations for the designs though,
            those will be shown below.

            This was a project for one of my classes, called Responsive Multi
            Device Design (RMDD). During this project, the focus laid on the
            ability to make an interactive experience, with designing the
            solution for multiple devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Points of interest for this project were to think about the context
            of the user, consistency of the design across devices, and thinking
            about what information needed to be displayed and in what way.
          </p>

          <p>
            The assignment was to come up with and design a multi-device
            experience for a specific activity (such as traveling, fitness,
            going to the movies, playing games, etc.). One of the key points to
            think about where the user goals, that were important before, during
            and after the activity, and what device would be appropriate for
            that occasion.
          </p>

          <p>
            The solution needed to be visualized in a screenflow, so that the
            functionalities of the product would be clearly explained and
            visible across all used devices.

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>Start</h3>
          <p>
            I started with thinking about what kind of activity I wanted to make
            this project for. I had bit of a struggle with this, because I
            didn't want to do something that had been done a lot before, and
            what interested me. I first thought of something with plants or
            crystals, seeing those are two of my hobbies, but after a bit of
            brainstorming, I thought of something that I would have liked to
            exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            I, like you might have noticed, am a huge Dungeons &amp; Dragons
            enthousiast, and that is also the reason why quite a few of my
            projects have something to do with this wonderful hobby. When I'm
            playing D&amp;D myself, I notice that sometimes I struggle when I'm
            deeply in combat or roleplay, to pay attention to everything.
            Especially if my character takes any damage, but for example I was
            figuring out my next turn in combat, I had to break from those plans
            to fill in my damage taken in the Hit Points area.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/img/process/RMDD/wireframeSmartWatch1.png"
            alt="part of the wireframes design for the smartwatch, made by Yara Prins"
          />
          <p>
            This would get a bit frustrating and time consuming after a while,
            and this is where I thought of my concept. D&amp;D Hit Points
            connects your smartwatch to your D&amp;D Beyond Account, letting you
            set your damage or healing with a simple gesture around your wrist,
            letting you keep focus for the rest of the game.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Design &amp; Functionalities</h3>
          <p>
            I started making the designs by working out the wireframes and the
            screenflow of the user experience. First up, the laptop designs. I
            knew I wanted it to connect to an existing d&amp;d tool and website
            called D&amp;D Beyond. I've replicated this website ones during one
            of my <a href="./dndBeyond.html">other projects</a>, but this
            project is an addition to this tool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because I knew that I wanted to add to an already existing website,
            making the laptop designs was very easy and fast to do. I made rough
            wireframes of the existing designs of a charactersheet page, and
            added on top of that. Mainly, adding the buttons and ways to connect
            to your smartwatch. After that, I made a Hi-Fi screenflow how it
            would work, and how potential error states would look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was done with the laptop designs, I tried to translate the
            most important parts the character sheet into the smartwatch app. I
            noted down the things that I needed to have or be able to do in the
            app, and what could be left for the laptop or other device versions.
            After all that, I came with a few things that needed to be included
            in the app: being able to connect to your D&amp;D Beyond account,
            selecting (one of) your character(s), showing your Hit Points and a
            way to edit them, Death Saving Throws, and Conditions (being
            blinded, stunned, poisoned, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            These functionalities needed to be a part of the designs, and I
            slowly started to expand the design. First, just like before, I made
            wireframes for the smartwatch designs, to see the placement and
            sizing of the content. After, I converted those wireframes into a
            Hi-Fi screenflow. I did have some iterations for the designs though,
            those will be shown below.

            This was a project for one of my classes, called Responsive Multi
            Device Design (RMDD). During this project, the focus laid on the
            ability to make an interactive experience, with designing the
            solution for multiple devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Points of interest for this project were to think about the context
            of the user, consistency of the design across devices, and thinking
            about what information needed to be displayed and in what way.
          </p>

          <p>
            The assignment was to come up with and design a multi-device
            experience for a specific activity (such as traveling, fitness,
            going to the movies, playing games, etc.). One of the key points to
            think about where the user goals, that were important before, during
            and after the activity, and what device would be appropriate for
            that occasion.
          </p>

          <p>
            The solution needed to be visualized in a screenflow, so that the
            functionalities of the product would be clearly explained and
            visible across all used devices.

          <h3>Start</h3>
          <p>
            I started with thinking about what kind of activity I wanted to make
            this project for. I had bit of a struggle with this, because I
            didn't want to do something that had been done a lot before, and
            what interested me. I first thought of something with plants or
            crystals, seeing those are two of my hobbies, but after a bit of
            brainstorming, I thought of something that I would have liked to
            exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            I, like you might have noticed, am a huge Dungeons &amp; Dragons
            enthousiast, and that is also the reason why quite a few of my
            projects have something to do with this wonderful hobby. When I'm
            playing D&amp;D myself, I notice that sometimes I struggle when I'm
            deeply in combat or roleplay, to pay attention to everything.
            Especially if my character takes any damage, but for example I was
            figuring out my next turn in combat, I had to break from those plans
            to fill in my damage taken in the Hit Points area.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            This would get a bit frustrating and time consuming after a while,
            and this is where I thought of my concept. D&amp;D Hit Points
            connects your smartwatch to your D&amp;D Beyond Account, letting you
            set your damage or healing with a simple gesture around your wrist,
            letting you keep focus for the rest of the game.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Design &amp; Functionalities</h3>
          <p>
            I started making the designs by working out the wireframes and the
            screenflow of the user experience. First up, the laptop designs. I
            knew I wanted it to connect to an existing d&amp;d tool and website
            called D&amp;D Beyond. I've replicated this website ones during one
            of my <a href="./dndBeyond.html">other projects</a>, but this
            project is an addition to this tool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because I knew that I wanted to add to an already existing website,
            making the laptop designs was very easy and fast to do. I made rough
            wireframes of the existing designs of a charactersheet page, and
            added on top of that. Mainly, adding the buttons and ways to connect
            to your smartwatch. After that, I made a Hi-Fi screenflow how it
            would work, and how potential error states would look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was done with the laptop designs, I tried to translate the
            most important parts the character sheet into the smartwatch app. I
            noted down the things that I needed to have or be able to do in the
            app, and what could be left for the laptop or other device versions.
            After all that, I came with a few things that needed to be included
            in the app: being able to connect to your D&amp;D Beyond account,
            selecting (one of) your character(s), showing your Hit Points and a
            way to edit them, Death Saving Throws, and Conditions (being
            blinded, stunned, poisoned, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            These functionalities needed to be a part of the designs, and I
            slowly started to expand the design. First, just like before, I made
            wireframes for the smartwatch designs, to see the placement and
            sizing of the content. After, I converted those wireframes into a
            Hi-Fi screenflow. I did have some iterations for the designs though,
            those will be shown below.
