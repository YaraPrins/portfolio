Hi,
My name is Yara.
I am a Graphic Design & Front End Development Student
In this portfolio, you will find my most notable works so far in my studies and personal work. Feel free to roam around, inspect the code, or to contact me for any further questions and/ or for work.

I'm now a fourth year Communication & Multimedia Design student on the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. I have a love for design as well as coding, and I'm a very eager learner.

I'm a very enthusiastic, positive, talkative and kind person, and I'm always in for a bit of banter. Generally speaking though, I'm just a massive nerd. Besides coding and designing, I love playing Dungeons & Dragons, watching Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, playing games such as Assassins Creed, Portal, Life is Strange, The Last of Us and more. I like photography, making art, listen to a ton of different music, and I love going to concerts.
